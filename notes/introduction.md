# Presentation

- 45 minutes for presentation and QA session
- Review presentation a few weeks before, with teachers

# E-voting introduction

- Switzerland kind of leading in terms of transparent e-voting
  - Compare e.g. US which has trusted hardware for safety, rather than
    cryptographic protocols. Less transparency
