  abstract = {Punchscan is a unique hybrid paper/electronic voting system concept. As a receipt-based system, Punchscan provides high voter privacy and election integrity, yet it does not rely on the complex and fragile electronic voting machines found in many current implementations. In this paper, we define the Punchscan system and voting protocol, including the people, objects and events involved and the ways they interact. We also trace the flow of data throughout the election process. This definition will aid those implementing the Punchscan system, but also lays a foundation for critical analysis and discussion within the voting research community.},

  abstract = {Prêt à Voter and Punchscan are two electronic voting schemes that both use paper based ballot forms, part of which is detached and destroyed, to provide receipt-free voter verifiability. However, both schemes share the chain voting problem and the part destruction problem. The first is where anyone who can see the ballot form before it is used can coerce a voter who uses it and the latter where a voter who can leave with the complete form can prove to a coercer the contents of the vote. In this paper we provide a comparison of the schemes from a systems perspective. We also introduce a visual encryption solution to both the above problems.},

  abstract = {In this article, we propose a new voting protocol with several desirable security properties. The voting stage of the protocol can be performed by humans without computers; it provides every voter with the means to verify that all the votes were counted correctly (universal verifiability) while preserving ballot secrecy. The protocol has “everlasting privacy”: Even a computationally unbounded adversary gains no information about specific votes from observing the protocol's output. Unlike previous protocols with these properties, this protocol distributes trust between two authorities: a single corrupt authority will not cause voter privacy to be breached. Finally, the protocol is receipt-free: A voter cannot prove how she voted even if she wants to do so. We formally prove the security of the protocol in the universal composability framework, based on number-theoretic assumptions.},
